# Project Title: Search Engine Development in C++ ( Self Project )
## Project Description:
Developed a high-performance Search Engine in C++ from scratch, leveraging advanced data 
structures and memory management techniques. The project focused on providing a fully functional and 
lightning-fast search experience while demonstrating proficiency in object-oriented programming, memory 
management, and project organization.
## Key Project Highlights:
• Implemented a comprehensive search engine in C++ that can efficiently process large volumes of 
data.

• Utilized fundamental data structures like structs, classes, and maps to optimize search operations 
and improve performance.

• Demonstrated in-depth understanding of memory management techniques, ensuring efficient 
memory allocation and deallocation.

• Leveraged the Trie data structure to enable fast and efficient search functionality.

• Designed and implemented an input manager function to handle user input and redirect program 
flow accordingly.

• Developed search functions to find occurrences of a word in specific documents and across all 
documents.

• Integrated a heap data structure for sorting and presenting search results based on relevance.

• Ensured the project's responsiveness and speed by optimizing search algorithms and data structures.

• Maintained a well-structured project organization, facilitating easy maintenance and future 
enhancements.

## Skills Demonstrated:
• Object-oriented programming: Implemented classes and structs to encapsulate data and 
functionality.

• Data structures: Utilized maps, tries, and heaps for efficient data storage and retrieval.

• Memory management: Demonstrated correct memory allocation and deallocation techniques.

• Algorithm optimization: Employed efficient search algorithms to achieve fast search results.

• Project organization: Maintained a well-structured project layout for improved maintainability.

This Search Engine project showcases my ability to build complex applications in C++, leveraging advanced 
data structures and memory management techniques. It demonstrates my proficiency in solving real-world 
problems while considering performance and efficiency.



### to compile it
make to run it pass to the same folder a txt file with the correct format such as(smalldataset and bigdataset) or give relative path or full path
./searchengine -d smalldataset.txt -k 5
